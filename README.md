## My first readme
This is my first repository created at ALX Software engineering internship. We are currently on the onboarding phase which will end by the end of this month of August, 2022. However, while this task is supposed to get our hands dirty and be familiar with some foundational knowledge to get started in this program. I can say I'm feeling pretty confident to begin the journey to being the best of me i set out to be in the first place.
